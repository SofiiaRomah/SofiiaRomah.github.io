## It is my new project!

So here I want to tell you some information about my previous task. It was about how to create a project, make there issues ans solve them.

## What is "issue" on GitHub?

With issues, you can:

1. Track and prioritize your work using project boards. For more information, see "Using project boards."
2. Associate issues with pull requests so that your issue automatically closes when you merge a pull request. For more information, see "Closing issues using keywords."
3. Create issue templates to help contributors open meaningful issues. For more information, see "About issue and pull request templates."
4. Transfer open issues to other repositories. For more information, see "Transferring an issue to another repository."
5. Pin important issues to make them easier to find, preventing duplicate issues and reducing noise. For more information, see "Pinning an issue to your repository."
6. Track duplicate issues using saved replies. For more information, see "About saved replies."
7. Report comments that violate GitHub's Community Guidelines. For more information, see "Reporting abuse or spam."

## Creating an issue

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click  Issues.
3. Click New issue.
4. If there are multiple issue types, click Get started next to the type of issue you'd like to open.
5. Type a title and description for your issue.
6. If you're a project maintainer, you can assign the issue to someone, add it to a project board, associate it with a milestone, or apply a label.
7. When you're finished, click Submit new issue
