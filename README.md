## It is my new project!

So here I want to tell you some information about my previous task. It was about how to create a project, make there issues ans solve them.

## What is an "issue" on GitHub?

With issues, you can:

- Track and prioritize your work using project boards. For more information, see "Using project boards."
- Associate issues with pull requests so that your issue automatically closes when you merge a pull request. For more information, see "Closing issues using keywords."
- Create issue templates to help contributors open meaningful issues. For more information, see "About issue and pull request templates."
- Transfer open issues to other repositories. For more information, see "Transferring an issue to another repository."
- Pin important issues to make them easier to find, preventing duplicate issues and reducing noise. For more information, see "Pinning an issue to your repository."
- Track duplicate issues using saved replies. For more information, see "About saved replies."
- Report comments that violate GitHub's Community Guidelines. For more information, see "Reporting abuse or spam."

## Creating an issue

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click  **Issues**.
3. Click **New issue**.
4. If there are multiple issue types, click **Get started** next to the type of issue you'd like to open.
5. Type a _title_ and _description_ for your issue.
6. If you're a project maintainer, you can assign the issue to someone, add it to a project board, associate it with a milestone, or apply a label.
7. When you're finished, click **Submit new issue**
